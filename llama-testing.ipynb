      "3. **Humanist approach**: From this viewpoint, the meaning of life lies in human experience, values, and relationships. It's about cultivating our unique potential, fostering connections with others, and pursuing happiness and fulfillment.\n",
      "4. **Scientific perspective**: Some scientists argue that the meaning of life is to perpetuate our species, ensure the survival of humanity, or contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding.\n",
